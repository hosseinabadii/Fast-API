# Posts API

This is a FastAPI-based project for managing a collection of posts. The API allows clients to perform CRUD operations on the posts.

This project uses `SQLite3` as its database. `SQLite3` is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process. It allows for easy setup and quick development.

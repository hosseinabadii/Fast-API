## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, while also being highly efficient and scalable.

SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a set of high-level API for working with relational databases, allowing you to interact with databases using Python objects and SQL expressions.

This repository aims to provide practical examples and projects that demonstrate how to leverage the capabilities of FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to build robust and efficient web APIs with database integration.

## Features

- Integration of FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for database operations
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- Authentication and authorization using FastAPI security features
- Data validation and request/response models with Pydantic
